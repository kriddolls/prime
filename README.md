 Test
two simple scala files.
Prime.scala - Prime singleton object with nth method.
- goal to find the nth prime number.

- broken down into isprime method. returns boolean true or false
- find next prime method to get the next prime number. allows to write a simple loop with nth to get that particular prime
- nth is the loop method with simple logic to stop at that nth value.

Main.scala - simple test of the prime object.
hard coded value, if return value is expected, then it is successful.

- coded to fulfill the basic need of the test.
- obviously this could run into issues if the nth is a very large number.
- no thoughts to memory usage or real performance.
